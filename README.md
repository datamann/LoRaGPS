## LoRaGPS (This REAME is work in progress)

Sending GPS coordinates via LoRa Radio 433MHz and 868MHz

### LoRaGPS/Intro

- As of now this project is only to learn how to use LoRa modules and to have radio devices to test antennas. For now I only use fabricated antennas but I will build my own.
- End goal for this project is to control an antenna tracker, this used as an telemetry link.

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

- I was not able to find a userfriendly telemetry link so I started to build my own and to learn the technology. 
- This project are so far not really userfriendly either but the goal is to try to create a step by step user guide with a complete parts list and "How to" bullet list.

### Contributing
- No other than me are contributing so far and no guide lines are specified.

### TODO
- Basic function are complete but code optimization is needed.
- Next step is to be able to control an antenna tracker with telemetry link.
- None known bugs as of now
